//Notes from lecture 16

Midterm review 
1/3 = 0 since they are integers 
destrutor is called when delete is called, when last unique or shared pointer is gone
sort a heap by inserting all items then removong all items 
linked list are slowest to binary search or access an element close to tail 
Access control is for helping you work in large teams 
~ symbol is the bitwise negation
heap is in std library as priority queues

  int var;
    cin >> var;
    int a[var][var];            //This works

    cout << (17 << 3) << endl;      //pordcues 136


Learning... 
    Iterative Discotimizer 3
decision tree, where each layer of tree will split total population into many groups which classify outcome of situation
at each leaf of the tree, metrics are produced which show 
    which people have been misclassified, how many people were placed in that decision and % error 
final project will take in a data, analyze it and present it
    will be given file in csv format 
This is a project on classifying things based on metrics measured

File will have classifiers followed by the object being claddified
You can use the metrics to to determine which ranges of the metrics result in the various objects
    example is iris.data file 

This will be implmented using recursion 
    look at parameters that differ two types of values, create a split
    do this again in for each branch 

How to deal with data: 
    need to determine the number of columns, last one will always be a string 
    reccomned using templates 
    tree will have leaves that are classes containing relevant data items 
    Decision in tree may have a leaf or another decision linked to it 

output format is undecided
